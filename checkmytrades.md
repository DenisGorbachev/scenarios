### _(draft)_ System calculates "Profit" metric
* Ideas:
  * Show assets for period + cost + unrealized profit (accounting for slippage, which should be determined by orderbook depth ~ can use CoinMarketBook)
* Decisions: 
  * How to calculate metric if position has been taken before selected period?
    * Ideally: get full trade history, calculate position open and close timestamps, exclude open positions from selected period
  * How to calculate metric if position has been taken on one exchange and closed on another?
    * Track all exchanges
    * Show position as pending if Trader hasn't connected another exchange
  * How to calculate metric if position has been opened / closed on exchange that is already down?
    * Allow to manually add trades
      * Mark them as added manually
  * How to calculate metric over deposits / withdrawals?
    * Use position size for calculations
      * Calculate profit per unit of base asset?
