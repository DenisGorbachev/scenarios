## Definitions 

### Developer

Developer is a person who writes computer programs.

### Use case

Use case is a sequence of events that describes expected usage of the program.

Examples:
* https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/use-cases.html

Alternative names:
* User story
* Scenario

A set of use cases is also called:
* Specification
* Requirements document

Note: a story written according to Storytailor rules is a general kind of use case (because a story may also describe the existing state of affairs, not just the expected usage of a particular program).

### Test

Test is a piece of [code](#code) that runs another piece of code & compares the actual result with expected result. 

### Code

A sequence of characters that can be executed by computer.
